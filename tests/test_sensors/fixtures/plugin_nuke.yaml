    # This next argument specifies the output of the write_farm node.
    # Write nodes are able to take extra arguments i.e. like this:
    # WriteNode.file: [argv 0]/write_farm/[argv 1].####.[argv 2] etc.
    # So, [argv <index>]
    # write_farm.file has "[argv 0]" as value (as of now),
    # so the last argument of this args must be the full, absolute
    # path of the final image.

    # This allows to specify the output from commandline
    # However, this needs a special Write Node that
    # reads the sysargv to redirect the output

    # If a write node is expecting an argument that was
    # not specified, the error would look somehow
    # like this:
    # Missing command-line argument #2 for write_farm.file
